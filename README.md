Introduction
BECKY is a smart learning tool designed to help individuals learn to play their favorite music pieces on the piano. Personally, I love music and often sing my favorite pieces. For as long as I can remember, I've always wanted to go beyond singing and play them on the piano. Unlike other instruments, the piano is just awesome!

Features
Inbuilt MIDI synthesizer: Sounds are simulated on a 30 USD Raspberry pi board. Saving you thousands of dolars that would have cost you to aquire a piano. 
Interactive Lessons: BECKY provides interactive lessons that guide you step-by-step through learning various pieces. With keys that light up, guiding you what keys to press
Progress Tracking: Keeps track of your progress , sends daily reminders for practice sessions as well as sending weekly reports straight to your email box, with a number of practise sessions you had, number of mistakes you made, and weeklu strikes achieved.
